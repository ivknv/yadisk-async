* **Release 1.3.6 (2023-01-20)**

  * Fixed `issue #26`_: ':' character in filenames causes :code:`BadRequestError`.
    This is due the behavior of Yandex.Disk's REST API itself but is avoided
    on the library level with this fix.

* **Release 1.3.5 (2022-11-10)**

  * Fixed a bug in :code:`is_file()` and :code:`is_dir()`: a typo was causing
    :code:`AttributeError` (`PR #6`_).

* **Release 1.3.4 (2022-08-17)**

  * Fixed a bug in :code:`check_token()`: could throw :code:`ForbiddenError` if
    the application lacks necessary permissions (`issue #23`_).

* **Release 1.3.3 (2021-12-31)**

  * Fixed an issue where :code:`http://` links were not recognized as operation links
    (they were assumed to always be :code:`https://`, since all the other
    requests are always HTTPS).
    Occasionally, Yandex.Disk can for some reason return an :code:`http://` link
    to an asynchronous operation instead of :code:`https://`.
    Both links are now recognized correctly and an :code:`https://` version will
    always be used by :code:`get_operation_status()`, regardless of which one
    Yandex.Disk returned.

* **Release 1.3.2 (2021-07-10)**

  * Fixed :code:`__version__` having the old value

* **Release 1.3.1 (2021-07-10)**

  * Fixed :code:`AttributeError` in :code:`SessionWithHeaders` (`PR #1`_)
  * Fixed trash bin tests

* **Release 1.3.0 (2019-07-06)**

  * Modified the original library (`yadisk`_) to support `async/await`
  * The library was renamed to `yadisk-async`

The following releases are for `yadisk`_, the original library:

* **Release 1.2.14 (2019-03-26)**

  * Fixed a :code:`TypeError` in :code:`get_public_*` functions when passing :code:`path` parameter
    (see `issue #7`_)
  * Added :code:`unlimited_autoupload_enabled` attribute for :code:`DiskInfoObject`

* **Release 1.2.13 (2019-02-23)**

  * Added :code:`md5` parameter for :code:`remove()`
  * Added :code:`UserPublicInfoObject`
  * Added :code:`country` attribute for :code:`UserObject`
  * Added :code:`photoslice_time` attribute for :code:`ResourceObject`, :code:`PublicResourceObject`
    and :code:`TrashResourceObject`

* **Release 1.2.13 (2019-02-23)**

  * Added :code:`md5` parameter for :code:`remove()`
  * Added :code:`UserPublicInfoObject`
  * Added :code:`country` attribute for :code:`UserObject`
  * Added :code:`photoslice_time` attribute for :code:`ResourceObject`, :code:`PublicResourceObject`
    and :code:`TrashResourceObject`

* **Release 1.2.12 (2018-10-11)**

  * Fixed `fields` parameter not working properly in `listdir()` (`issue #4`_)

* **Release 1.2.11 (2018-06-30)**

  * Added the missing parameter :code:`sort` for :code:`get_meta()`
  * Added :code:`file` and :code:`antivirus_status` attributes for :code:`ResourceObject`,
    :code:`PublicResourceObject` and :code:`TrashResourceObject`
  * Added :code:`headers` parameter
  * Fixed a typo in :code:`download()` and :code:`download_public()` (`issue #2`_)
  * Removed :code:`*args` parameter everywhere

* **Release 1.2.10 (2018-06-14)**

  * Fixed :code:`timeout=None` behavior. :code:`None` is supposed to mean 'no timeout' but
    in the older versions it was synonymous with the default timeout.

* **Release 1.2.9 (2018-04-28)**

  * Changed the license to LGPLv3 (see :code:`COPYING` and :code:`COPYING.lesser`)
  * Other package info updates

* **Release 1.2.8 (2018-04-17)**

  * Fixed a couple of typos: :code:`PublicResourceListObject.items` and
    :code:`TrashResourceListObject.items` had wrong types
  * Substitute field aliases in :code:`fields` parameter when performing
    API requests (e.g. :code:`embedded` -> :code:`_embedded`)

  * Fixed a file rewinding bug when uploading/downloading files after a retry

* **Release 1.2.6 (2018-04-13)**

* **Release 1.2.5 (2018-03-31)**

  * Fixed an off-by-one bug in :code:`utils.auto_retry()`
    (which could sometimes result in :code:`AttributeError`)
  * Retry the whole request for :code:`upload()`, :code:`download()` and :code:`download_public()`
  * Set :code:`stream=True` for :code:`download()` and :code:`download_public()`
  * Other minor fixes

* **Release 1.2.4 (2018-02-19)**

  * Fixed :code:`TokenObject` having :code:`exprires_in` instead of :code:`expires_in` (fixed a typo)

  * Fixed a :code:`TypeError` when :code:`WrongResourceTypeError` is raised

* **Release 1.2.2 (2018-01-19)**

* **Release 1.2.1 (2018-01-14)**

  * Fixed auto retries not working. Whoops.

* **Release 1.2.0 (2018-01-14)**

  * Fixed passing :code:`n_retries=0` to :code:`upload()`,
    :code:`download()` and :code:`download_public()`
  * :code:`upload()`, :code:`download()` and :code:`download_public()`
    no longer return anything (see the docs)
  * Added :code:`utils` module (see the docs)
  * Added :code:`RetriableYaDiskError`, :code:`WrongResourceTypeError`,
    :code:`BadGatewayError` and :code:`GatewayTimeoutError`

    instead of :code:`NotADirectoryError`

* **Release 1.1.1 (2017-12-29)**

  * Fixed argument handling in :code:`upload()`, :code:`download()` and :code:`download_public()`.
    Previously, passing :code:`n_retries` and :code:`retry_interval` would raise an exception (:code:`TypeError`).

* **Release 1.1.0 (2017-12-27)**

  * Better exceptions (see the docs)
  * Added support for :code:`force_async` parameter
  * Minor bug fixes
